## Pure Mathematics

A Rosetta Stone for Mathematics | Quanta Magazine
In 1940 André Weil wrote a letter to his sister, Simone, outlining his vision for translating between three distinct areas of mathematics. Eighty years later, it still animates many of the most exciting developments in the field.

The Biggest Problem in Mathematics Is Finally a Step Closer to Being Solved
Number theorists have been trying to prove a conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers for more than 160 years.

Monumental Proof Settles Geometric Langlands Conjecture | Quanta Magazine
In work that has been 30 years in the making, mathematicians have proved a major part of a profound mathematical vision called the Langlands program.

Personal note on Langlands:
An interesting aside. The analogy to Spectral analysis and Waves may make it interesting to some of you. It's a pretty comprehensive overview of the Langlands program — especially the video that summarizes the links between disparate fields that resulted in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. It still leaves much unsaid (in layman terms) about certain areas — and makes you want more description on things like sheaves.

Division on Soroban (Japanese Abacus, Jimmy Wu, YouTube)
https://youtu.be/1XwL-FGQxy0

Multiplication worked example:
```
45 x 123 = 5535

Step 1: 123 is a 3 digit number, 45 is a 2 digit number, Product is treated as a 3+2=5 digit number. Each digit from the left are multiplied one at a time to give a 2 digit number i.e. 1x4 = 04 which is written down in the 5th position from the right.
Step 2: 2 x 4 = 08 written from the 4th digit.
Step 3: 3x4 = 12 written from the 3rd digit from the right.
Step 4: 1x5 = 05 written into the 4th digit from right.
  When any number causes overflow we split relative to 5 — add 10 to higher power, subtract 5 from lower power.
Step 5: 2x5 = 10. Adding 10 starting from the 3rd digit from the right.
Step 6: 3x5 = 15 added starting from 2nd digit.

123
  x45
——
04 <- 1x4
  08 <- 2x4
     12 <- 3x4
05 <- 1x5
  10 <- 2x5
     15 <- 3x5
Read as 05535

Claude Shannon biography notes (personal, Jun 2, 2024):
No hierarchy, infinitely curious, lazy to publish, ability to abstract into math while engineering, could ride unicycles (including off center one) and penny farthings. Juggled, wrote about the math of juggling, wanted a funeral with coffin carried by 6 unicyclists, has the law of entropy on the other side of his gravestone, grew a beard, took to running everyday in middle age, died of Alzheimer's. With Ed Thorpe, made the first wearable computer to win roulette, designed a (bouncing) juggling clown, a mouse to solve a maze, a chess robot that could do end games — before transistors, a Rubik's cube solver, lasted 42 moves against world number 1 chess player.
