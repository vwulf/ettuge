## What is this directory?

`self.md` is a large personal notes file — essentially a chronological dump of
saved links, code snippets, ideas, and observations accumulated from 2021 to
2024.  Because the source file has no structural headings, navigation is
difficult.  This directory provides **topic-based derivatives**: each file
collects and summarises a coherent theme, with links back to related source
material.

> **The source file is preserved untouched.** These files are read-only
> derivatives for easier browsing. If source content changes, re-derive from
> the updated `self.md`.

## Categorisation Scheme

Entries in `self.md` were grouped by **primary subject domain**.  Where a
single note could fit multiple categories (e.g. a ZIO + Kubernetes article)
it was placed in the most specific category and cross-linked from others.
Entries that could not be reliably categorised are in *Miscellaneous*.
