Sebastian Nehrdich (@SebastianNehrd2): The earliest Western so-called translation of the Vedas is the "Ezour-Vedam" in 1778, likely by the missionary Robertus de Nobilibus. This work has been shown to be a forgery.
https://x.com/SebastianNehrd2/status/1814210765500387483

It's also unclear to me whether Ganesha is really a Vedic god, since the people who wrote (spoke) the earliest Vedas are unlikely to have seen an elephant — a discussion that BG Tilak himself was part of when he proposed that these people were from the Arctic/North pole. Considering Tilak's views and any historical dig up, I can't see how elephants or elephant gods are related to the earlier Vedas at least.
