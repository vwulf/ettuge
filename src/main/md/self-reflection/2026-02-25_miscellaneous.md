## The "Cult of X" (personal note, Jul 11, 2024)

I was thinking of doing a "Cult of X" for some time.

The key precept of the cult (like Fight Club) would be do something odd once a week and something mind bending or just odd, once a month, but not really talk about it on Social Media.
If it comes up in conversation, you just brush it off and just give high level summary in a no big deal fashion.

You choose what you want to do — doesn't have to be physical like running but it must be odd enough to be memorable.
