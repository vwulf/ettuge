## Cultural perspective

This is mostly cultural commentary that can be open ended. Languages are
a contentious topic in India - like elsewhere.

The diversity of languages, history of various invasions, colonization,
the partition of India, linguistic organization of states, urbanization
and recent trend towards assertion of the Indian way of thinking (and
along with supremacist tendencies of language and religion) has created
a potpourri of opinions.

The commonly held viewpoint on languages often differs completely from
the academic consensus. On the flip side, there are traditions in
linguistic understanding that are more a couple of thousand years old,
the most impactful being pAnini and the schools of study of pANinian
grammar.

Although there is value in these traditions, we should also be mindful
of the fact that grammars of kannaDa and other DraviDian languages were
written by people who held that all non-samskxta languages were
apabramhSAs (or corrupted speech). In the drive for standardization, non
PIE language families have been studied with the same scheme that
applied by pANini for samskxrta.

It's only with the advent of modern linguistics, etymology and phylogeny
that alternates have emerged. Although there's been many that are not
mentioned here, AK rAmAnujan's attempts to write a generative grammar
for kannaDa and the recent exhaustive work of Sankara BaT in writing a
grammar for kannaDa from first principles which have resulted in a
grammar which doesn't follow the same template of Samskxrta.
