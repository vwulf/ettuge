## Cultural perspective

This is mostly cultural commentary that can be open ended. Languages are
a contentious topic in India - like elsewhere.

The diversity of languages, history of various invasions, colonization,
the partition of India, linguistic organization of states, urbanization
and recent trend towards assertion of the Indian way of thinking (and
along with supremacist tendencies of language and religion) has created
a potpourri of opinions.

The commonly held viewpoint on languages often differs completely from
the academic consensus. On the flip side, there are traditions in
linguistic understanding that are more a couple of thousand years old,
the most impactful being pAnini and the schools of study of pANinian
grammar.

Although there is value in these traditions, we should also be mindful
of the fact that grammars of kannaDa and other DraviDian languages were
written by people who held that all non-samskxta languages were
apabramhSAs (or corrupted speech). In the drive for standardization, non
PIE language families have been studied with the same scheme that
applied by pANini for samskxrta.

It's only with the advent of modern linguistics, etymology and phylogeny
that alternates have emerged. Although there's been many that are not
mentioned here, AK rAmAnujan's attempts to write a generative grammar
for kannaDa and the recent exhaustive work of Sankara BaT in writing a
grammar for kannaDa from first principles which have resulted in a
grammar which doesn't follow the same template of Samskxrta.

This proposal itself began due to various cultural factors:

1. A lot of peers of the author could speak kannaDa but were lacking in ability to read, write or type kannaDa.

1. Experts in kannaDa in offline media - Reading, Writing were still experts in typing on a standard keyboard. Phone keyboards do much better, but still the gap remains.

1. Urban vocabulary and a little bit of rural consists a large part of English words which are intermixed.

1. Online interactions are mostly done in kanglish or English. The same is observed to be true of other Indic language speakers.

1. Typing diacritics on specialized keyboards requires some explicit prep that most people don't seem to do.

1. Programming Environments are so tuned to English that Unicode is often an afterthought. Indic scripts use more Unicde combinations than other 
non-English alphabets.

1. A lot of Indic language understanding falls neatly into language families. When expressed in a script that one can read (e.g. English) 
kannaDa, tamiZ, malayALam, tulu and telugu speakers (and even 1 brahui speaker anecdotally) seem to be able to read and follow along.

1. People who speak Non-Dravidian languages (Hindi, Marathi etc) are more exposed to English than the scripts of the South.

1. Northern Indian scripts are closer to each other than Southern Indian scripts due to the shared nagAri heritage. Southern Indian scripts have a long and wide history of writing and the statistics on Inscriptions found shows the same. E.g. tamiZ and kannaDa inscriptions outrank evey other inscription found in India [^32]. Due to the long history of usage, the divergence in scripts is higher. This makes it harder for people to read each others' scripts even though there is reasonable legibility across languages.

1. The author, found to his surprise, that he could read 2 languages from a different part of the world: i. Old Persian (a dead language in the middle east, written in Cuneiform [^31]) and ii. Avestan (a liturgical language of the Parsis who arrived in India a few centuries ago [^32]). The author was unaware of the closer relations between these languages and Sanskrit even after years of studying Sanskrit in school - due to the difference in scripts. In transliterated English, it can easily be seen that people who can read and understand Sanskrit can make out these languages as well.

1. A more common fact that the author discovered later than expected: Hindi and Urdu are 2 registers of the same language. The author often saw 2 completely different scripts and did not know that grammatically they are the same language till he heard an Urdu speaker from a different country and wondered why he was able to understand them. They are considered different languages only due to cultural and political factors. Vocabulary differences alone do not separate languages. E.g. a 20% difference in vocabulary may make speech unintelligble. Such differences often occur in dialects or registers of the same language. To be considered different languages, require unintelligibility and substantial changes in grammatical structure.

1. In India, there's lot of blind adherence to scripts as being part of the language or culture. It is part of the culture. However one needs to remember that writing in India arrived rather late. There's a gap of a millenium between IVC script and the brAhmi scripts. Brahmi scripts became widespread only in the Asokan period of 2300 years ago. However most Indian languages have a spoken history that can be traced to up to 4 - 5000 years using the techniques of Phonology (predicted changes in sounds), Phylogeny and Proto language construction. Using these techniques, words for Proto Indo European as Proto Dravidian languages have been constructed that are far older than written artefacts. The vocabulary available here is far richer than written artefacts which are often sparse and are surviving royal edicts on stones.

1. An English transliteration may well become a "link language" of South India - even if each language speaker wrote their own language in Eke. 

1. ISO, IAST, HK are all other possible choices. The author notes the prevalence of plain English text on all online channels to show why scripts with diacritics will not gain wide acceptance.
