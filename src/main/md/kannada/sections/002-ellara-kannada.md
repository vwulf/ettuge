## ellara kannaDa

"Ellara Kannada" (ellara kannaDa / EK) is a proposal aimed at reducing
the gap between spoken and written Kannada language. This was proposed
by the eminent linguist and padmaSri award winner D.N.Shankara Bhat
(D.N.Sankara BhaT). Some features of EK include eschewing the use of
mahaprANas (ottuli or breathed consonants) and emphasize usage and
construction of native kannaDa words. It uses the orthography of ಹೊಸಬರಹ
instead of ಕನ್ನಡ.
