## Goals and Non goals

Eke prioritizes ellara kannaDa[^2] over formal kannaDa given its simplicity
and implicit appeal to ease of use. Eke doesn't have the same goals as
HK[^9]. HK aims to faithfully retain the original spelling in devanAgari
i.e. the original spelling in devaNagari can be reconstructed from text
in HK.

Eke also does not attempt to solve the spelling problems of English.
Although there are several attempts to do so like Arpabet[^3], wiki
pronunciation for English[^4] there's no clear consensus. IPA [^10] is quite
complete but complex to learn and the extensive use of diacritics makes
it difficult to use on standard desktop and phone keyboards.

Attempting to unify Indic pronunciations and English is quite tricky. No
attempt will be made to synthesize them.

Although ellara kannaDa achieves a 77% complexity reduction from
35x35x21 ≈ 25725 to 21x21x13 ≈ 5733 symbols, its still a significant
number of symbols to learn. Eliminating ottakSaras could achieve a
further reduction to 21x13 ≈ 273 symbols.

This simplification is automatically obtained in usage of an alphabet
set (without diacritics). There is a reduction in precision in certain
cases. Eke, like HK goes down this line with only slight modifications.

Eke will use 31 symbols for all of ellara kannaDa(ek), 41 symbols for formal
kannada including historical symbols and 44 to incorporate english f, w,
z.

When Eke is used with ellara kannaDa (ek) simplifications, the term
"Eke(ek)" will be used.

If it is a direct transliteration from any text, without any
alterations, the term "Eke" is used.
