## akSaras (abugidAs) vs alphabets

Brahmic scripts dating back to the oldest archealogical sources are used
as aksharas (akSaras in EK terminology akSharas in formal kannaDa) or
abugidas as linguists often refer to them.

Kharoshti has been linked to Phoenician origin but the links between
Brahmi to Phoenician are disputed by certain scholars.

IAST and other alphabets have been used to represent brahmic scripts.
Other than HK, most other use diacritics quite heavily - mostly for avoiding ambiguity.
