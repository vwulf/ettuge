## Top 100 ottakSaras

The below table has character counts for ottakSaras that occur 100 or more times in alar.
The table also shows mapping from formal to ek ottaksaras and its counts as well.

The below table summarizes the spread of ottakSaras in kannaDa and EK.
The top 100/1296 account for an overwhelming 91% of all ottakSaras in
kannaDa. The top 100/441 account for 94% of all ottakSaras.

Given that ottakSaras form 6% of the total characters (12% of the
consonants), we can see why obscure combinations and sparseness of the
permutations between characters can cause a large number of symbols
which are only rarely encountered. Using Eke automatically obviates the
need to recognize an entire parallel scheme of characters. As long as
ottakSaras are used, the following spread of frequencies will make it
hard to simplify them.

Doubled characters form about 38% of ottakSaras. Using kannaDa native
words or the process of tadBavization of foreign words can also simplify
these permutations but not eliminate the need for learning 2 symbol sets
for consonants.
