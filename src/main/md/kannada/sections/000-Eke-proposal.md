# Eke (ಏಕೆ) - A proposal for transcribing Kannada

This proposal attempts to address the slight divergence in informal
writing for kannada (kannaDa) that is already in use in various channels
on the internet. It is a slight variation of the Harvard Kyoto
protocol(HK) adapted to kannaDa.

For lack of a better term, there's already an informal scheme in use to
transcribe kannaDa. Let's call it IK (informal kannaDa). Eke walks a
line between IK and HK.

The default sans serif fonts on wikitext may cause ambiguity between
**l** (small el) and **I**(capital Ay). There are quite a few other
fonts that avoid this ambiguity.
