## ಹೊಸಬರಹ / hosabaraha

The gist of ಹೊಸಬರಹ is to address the disconnect in how common people
speak and (mostly can’t) read/write Kannada. Note that EK's a holistic
approach to using native kannaDa words, inventing new words using
kannaDa native constructs, using a native kannaDa grammar which does not
rely on external techniques like Sanskrit along with the orthography of
ಹೊಸಬರಹ. We use EK interchangably with ಹೊಸಬರಹ in the remaining portion of
the article.

For ottakSaras, 35x35 consonant symbols are reduced to 21x21 symbols.
These would be combined with the following 10 vowels and 3 modifiers
instead of 16 vowels and 5 modifiers.

Complexity reduction is from 35x35x21 ≈ 25725 to 21x21x13 ≈ 5733
symbols. Its about a 77% reduction in symbols, greatly simplifying
reading/writing without any loss of fidelity for pronunciation in
Kannada (but not classical or Vedic Sanskrit).

Aspiration (mahAprANa) from phonology perspective is the same as ಹ
otthu.

So ಕ ಖ ಗ ಘ = ಕ ಕ್ಹ ಗ ಗ್ಹ

Since aspiration is not used in common speech in Kannada (unlike Hindi
and Sanskrit), ಕ ಗ would suffice.

Simplifications like those drop 25 “ordered”consonants into 13 ಕಗ ಚಜ ಟಡಣ
ತದನ ಪಬಮ This would eliminate the following ಖಘಙ ಛಝಞ ಠಢ ಥಧ ಫಭ

ಙ ಞ ಣ ನ ಮ with nasalization/non standalone are represented by anusvara
ಂ. The first 2 don’t occur in standalone form in Kannada. So ಮಂಗ, ಗಂಜಿ,
ಗಂಟೆ, ತಂದೆ, ಪಂಪ are the five variants.

“unordered” would simplify to ಯರಲವಶಸಹಳ Eliminating ಱೞಷ which are not
used.

Coming to vowels ಅಆಇಈಉಊಎಏಒಓ are retained.

ಋೠಌೡಐಔಅಃ are not. See [^16] for correct
pronunciation of these in Sanskrit. It’s not important/relevant in
Kannada.

ಐಔ (diphthongs) need special mention. In Sanskrit only ai, ou occurs
frequently, hence the special symbols. In Kannada ಆಯ್, ಎಯ್, ಏಯ್, ಓಯ್ etc are
common. It’s more uniform to use ಅಯ್ than ಐ, ಅವ್ than ಔ.

It's similar to why Sanskrit has क्षत्रज्ञ are special characters but
unnecessary as symbols in Kannada and formed by ಕ್ಷತ್ರಜ್ಞ. In hosabaraha,
ಕ್ಶ, ತ್ರ, ಗ್ನ್ಯ or ಜ್ನ್ಯ or ಗ್ಯ (depending on pronunciation).

Modifiers ್ಂ are retained. ಃ ೱ are not. ಼ is debatable. It’s useful for
indicating foreign languages like English, Hindi and Sanskrit- like fa,
za, bank, odd etc.
