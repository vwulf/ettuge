## Use in computation

Diacritics makes it harder to type and use on regular english keyboards
although unicode has made it increasingly easier to render text. Word
processors, Spreadsheets are more usable wrt unicode than programming
focused environments. Non-english scripts are also less prevalent in
programming languages and scripting tools. Lack of full unicode support
in programming editors, command lines make them harder to use. See [^29]
for details.
