### Eke consonants

Below table has the ottulis merged into kiridulis since ottulis are
represented by an additional h. ottakSaras also map to the underlying
consonant representation reflecting the real spread of consonants.

Frequency tables are listed for EK representations only. As expected
ottulis fall below every EK consonant in the frequency distribution of
characters in words found in the alar dictionary.
