ERROR: Error: 
Could not retrieve a transcript for the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j-3ROIe4tc! This is most likely caused by:

YouTube is blocking your requests, despite you using proxies. Keep in mind that a proxy is just a way to hide your real IP behind the IP of that proxy, but there is no guarantee that the IP of that proxy won't be blocked as well.

The only truly reliable way to prevent IP blocks is rotating through a large pool of residential IPs, by using a provider like Webshare (https://www.webshare.io/?referral_code=w0xno53eb50g), which provides you with a pool of >30M residential IPs (make sure to purchase "Residential" proxies, NOT "Proxy Server" or "Static Residential"!).

You will find more information on how to easily integrate Webshare here: https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api?tab=readme-ov-file#using-webshare

If you are sure that the described cause is not responsible for this error and that a transcript should be retrievable, please create an issue at https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api/issues. Please add which version of youtube_transcript_api you are using and provide the information needed to replicate the error. Also make sure that there are no open issues which already describe your problem!
