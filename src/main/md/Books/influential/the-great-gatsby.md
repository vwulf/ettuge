## Summary

Set in the summer of 1922 on Long Island's North Shore, *The Great Gatsby* is narrated by Nick Carraway, a Yale-educated Midwesterner who moves to the fictional West Egg and becomes neighbors with the enigmatic Jay Gatsby—a fabulously wealthy man of obscure origins who throws lavish parties he never seems to enjoy. Through Nick, we learn that Gatsby's entire fortune and social theater has been constructed for a single purpose: to win back Daisy Buchanan, his lost love, who is now married to the brutish old-money aristocrat Tom Buchanan. The novel is less a love story than a dissection of the American Dream as a tragedy of misplaced faith.

Fitzgerald renders the Jazz Age with extraordinary sensory precision: the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg staring down from a faded billboard over the Valley of Ashes, the parties where champagne flows and no one knows the host. The novel's real subject is the gap between aspiration and reality—and the violence that results when illusion meets the indifference of the world. Gatsby's faith that the past can be recovered is as doomed as it is beautiful, and Nick's narration gives it a quality of elegy throughout.

The novel was not a commercial success in Fitzgerald's lifetime and he died believing it a failure. Its canonical status—today it is regularly cited as the Great American Novel—was built posthumously, particularly through Edmund Wilson's editing of Fitzgerald's papers and Lionel Trilling's influential essay. *The Great Gatsby* endures because it captures something essential about the American relationship to self-invention, class, and the seductive cruelty of an unattainable ideal.

## Critical Takeaways

- **The American Dream as critique:** The novel is the first great fictional autopsy of the American Dream—the idea that self-invention, hard work, and desire can overcome class and circumstance. Gatsby proves the dream is a lie, particularly for those outside the inherited elite.
- **Class and old money vs. new money:** Tom Buchanan's casual brutality and Daisy's carelessness are Fitzgerald's indictment of old money; Gatsby's romance and criminality are new money's compensatory myth. Neither is innocent.
- **The unreliable narrator:** Nick Carraway is not neutral; he is complicit, admiring, and morally compromised. His famous opening claim to reserve judgment is immediately undercut. Critics have noted that the novel's power depends on this unreliability.
- **Color and symbol:** Fitzgerald's use of green (hope, the future), white (false purity), gold vs. yellow (real vs. false wealth), and grey (death, the Valley of Ashes) is among the most discussed symbolic systems in American fiction.
- **Prose style:** Fitzgerald's sentences—particularly the final paragraph ("So we beat on, boats against the current...")—are frequently cited as models of lyrical prose in the American tradition.

## My Takeaways

1. The green light is not merely a symbol—it's an emotion: the precise feeling of reaching toward something that recedes as you approach it. Fitzgerald makes aspiration itself feel like grief.
2. The Jazz Age setting is not backdrop but essence: the music, the parties, the excess are all ways of not looking at what the Valley of Ashes says about who pays for it all.
3. Tom and Daisy's "carelessness"—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money—is still the most damning description of a certain kind of inherited privilege I've read.
4. Re-reading as an adult, I noticed how the novel is also about Nick: his attraction to Gatsby, his complicity, his eventual retreat from New York. The story is as much about the witness as the witnessed.
