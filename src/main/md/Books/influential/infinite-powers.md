# Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe
**Author:** Steven Strogatz | **Published:** 2019

---

## Summary

*Infinite Powers* is Steven Strogatz's narrative history of calculus—from the ancient Greek method of exhaustion (Archimedes approximating the area of a parabola by inscribing polygons) through Newton and Leibniz, through Euler's formalization, through the 19th-century rigorous reformulation by Cauchy and Weierstrass, and into the 20th-century applications in physics, engineering, medicine, and biology. Strogatz, a professor of applied mathematics at Cornell, is one of the finest mathematics communicators of his generation, and *Infinite Powers* demonstrates calculus's ideas without requiring the reader to perform any calculations—the emphasis is on understanding what the concepts mean and why they work, rather than on techniques.

The organizing idea of the book is what Strogatz calls the "infinity principle": the strategy of breaking a problem into infinitely many infinitesimally small pieces, solving the simpler problem for each piece, and then adding the infinitely many solutions back together. This idea—the foundation of integration—is present in Archimedes' method 2,200 years ago, and Strogatz argues that most of the power of calculus comes from this one insight applied repeatedly in different domains. The derivative and the integral are dual aspects of this same fundamental move; the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which connects them, is the key result.

The book covers not only the historical development but the applications: the equations of planetary motion, the development of CT scanners (which use integration of X-ray data), the modeling of epidemic spread (the SIR differential equation), and the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and general relativity. By showing calculus in action in its most important applications, Strogatz makes the case that calculus is not a technique but a way of thinking—a mode of reasoning about change, accumulation, and the relationship between local behavior and global structure.

## Critical Takeaways

- **The infinity principle:** Strogatz's unifying concept—that calculus's power comes from the strategy of infinite subdivision—is a genuine simplification that captures something real about why the techniques work.
- **Applications:** The medical, physical, and biological applications sections demonstrate that calculus is not mathematics for its own sake but the essential language of quantitative science; understanding calculus is understanding how modern science describes the world.
- **Historical narrative:** The Newton-Leibniz priority dispute is handled with care; Strogatz acknowledges Leibniz's contributions without diminishing Newton's, and traces the separate development of calculus in the two traditions.
- **Rigor vs. intuition:** The book presents pre-rigorous calculus (Newton's fluxions, Leibniz's infinitesimals) with sympathy, explaining why the rigorous reformulation was necessary without making the earlier practitioners seem naive.
- **Strogatz's style:** Along with *The Joy of x* and *Sync*, *Infinite Powers* demonstrates a distinctive pedagogy: mathematics explained through story, application, and human drama rather than through formal definition and proof.

## My Takeaways

1. The Archimedes parabola argument—computing an exact area through a process of infinite approximation—showed me that the fundamental idea of calculus is 2,200 years old and is simply common sense taken to its logical limit.
2. The CT scanner application—that medical imaging depends on integral calculus—made the abstract machinery concrete in an unexpected way. I now think about the calculus running in the background of every diagnostic scan.
3. Strogatz's treatment of the epidemic SIR model—the differential equations describing disease spread—gave me the mathematical framework for thinking about exponential growth and its eventual saturation that COVID made suddenly urgent.
4. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus—the connection between the derivative and the integral—is one of mathematics' most beautiful results; Strogatz communicates the sense of inevitability and surprise that a great proof should produce.
