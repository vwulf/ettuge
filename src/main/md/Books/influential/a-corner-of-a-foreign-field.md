# A Corner of a Foreign Field: The Indian History of a British Sport
**Author:** Ramachandra Guha | **Published:** 2002

## Summary

*A Corner of a Foreign Field* is Ramachandra Guha's history of cricket in India—but more accurately, a history of India through cricket. Guha argues that cricket in India has been far more than a sport: it has been a domain in which the major social conflicts of modern Indian history—caste, religion, class, region, and nation—have been played out with unusual explicitness and urgency. The book begins with the origins of cricket in colonial India, traces the development of the Bombay Quadrangular and Pentangular tournaments (in which Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, and European teams competed against each other, making religious identity an explicit organizing principle of sport), and follows the career of Palwankar Baloo—a Dalit cricketer who became the finest bowler in Bombay cricket while being excluded from the full social rights of his team—as the central biographical thread of the early chapters.

The second half of the book traces Indian cricket through independence: the relationship between the BCCI's regional and caste-based political structure and the composition of the national team, the careers of specific players as social documents, and the role of cricket in creating a shared national identity across the subcontinent's profound social divisions. Guha's treatment of the question of whether cricket could be or has been a vehicle for social integration or whether it has merely reproduced existing social hierarchies in a new domain is analytically careful and empirically specific. The book is simultaneously social history, cricket history, and a methodological demonstration of how sport can be used as a lens for historical analysis.

Guha is one of India's most accomplished historians—his *India After Gandhi* is the standard one-volume history of post-independence India—and *A Corner of a Foreign Field* demonstrates his characteristic qualities: meticulous archival research, vivid biographical portraiture, analytical rigor, and genuine love for the subject. It is the best cricket history ever written and one of the best works of Indian social history of the last generation.

## Critical Takeaways

- **Sport as social history:** The book is a methodological argument for the seriousness of sport history—Guha demonstrates that cricket in India encodes and enacts social conflicts that cannot be fully understood through political or economic history alone.
- **Palwankar Baloo:** The biography of Baloo—a Dalit cricketer who played for Bombay in the 1900s-1910s, bowled out many of the greatest players of his era, and was refused equal seating with his teammates—is one of the most affecting stories in Indian caste history.
- **Religious tournaments:** The Bombay Quadrangular and Pentangular (Hindu, Muslim, Parsi, European, and eventually "the Rest") are unique in world sport history as tournaments organized explicitly on religious identity lines; Guha's account of their rise and eventual abolition is a complete history of Indian communal relations in miniature.
- **Ambedkar and cricket:** The book documents Ambedkar's ambivalence about Baloo's accommodationist strategy—playing within the discriminatory system rather than rejecting it—and uses this disagreement as a lens for understanding different strategies of Dalit resistance.
- **Cricket and national identity:** The argument that cricket has functioned as a domain for constructing and negotiating Indian national identity—more effectively than many explicitly political institutions—is the book's broadest and most significant claim.

## My Takeaways

1. The Palwankar Baloo story—a man excluded from full humanity by caste, but whose ability with a cricket ball could not be denied—is the purest example I know of how skill can create dignity that social hierarchy cannot entirely deny, while the limits of that dignity remain brutal.
2. The religious tournaments—cricket organized explicitly along communal lines, in the colonial city that would eventually produce Partition—are the precise intersection of sport and history that Guha claims: you cannot understand either without understanding both.
3. The argument that cricket created a shared national culture across India's linguistic and religious diversity—that Sachin Tendulkar belongs to a Tamil-speaking farmer and a Kashmiri merchant in a way that no political figure does—is empirically observable and analytically important.
4. The book taught me how to read sport as history: not as a metaphor for social conflict but as an arena in which social conflict actually happens, with specific outcomes and specific human beings who live with those outcomes.
