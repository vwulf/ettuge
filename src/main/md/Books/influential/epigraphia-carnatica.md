## Summary

*Epigraphia Carnatica* is the monumental multi-volume compilation of inscriptions from the Mysore (Karnataka) region, assembled by Benjamin Lewis Rice during his tenure as Director of Archaeological Survey in Mysore from the 1870s onwards. The work covers inscriptions from the Ganga, Hoysala, Rashtrakuta, Vijayanagara, and later periods, written in Kannada, Sanskrit, Tamil, and Telugu on copper plates, stone temples, and monuments across the region. Each inscription is presented with the original text, a transliteration, a translation, and Rice's commentary on historical interpretation—a methodology that established the standard for epigraphical work in South India and remains the primary reference for Kannada historical inscriptions.

The scale of the project is extraordinary: Rice personally documented thousands of inscriptions across dozens of districts, traveling through terrain that was largely inaccessible, and produced editions of consistent quality that subsequent scholars have built on for 130 years. The inscriptions documented in *Epigraphia Carnatica* are the primary source material for the political, social, economic, and cultural history of Karnataka before the modern period: they record royal grants of land and revenue, temple consecrations, military victories, merchant donations, caste regulations, and the biographies of commanders and administrators whose lives were otherwise unrecorded. Without Rice's compilation, the pre-modern history of Karnataka would be largely inaccessible.

Rice's work is significant not only as a compilation but as an act of cultural recovery. The 19th-century Kannada intellectual revival (the Vokkaligara movement, the development of modern Kannada prose, the recovery of classical Kannada literature) drew on the historical documentation that Rice made available. His companion work *Mysore and Coorg from the Inscriptions* synthesized the historical picture the inscriptions revealed, and his compilation of Kannada manuscripts (*A Catalogue of Sanskrit and Kannada Manuscripts in the Palace Library*) helped recover classical Kannada literary texts that would otherwise have been lost. Rice was a colonial official, but his work served the recovery of pre-colonial cultural heritage in ways that subsequent Kannada scholars have consistently acknowledged.

## Critical Takeaways

- **Primary source documentation:** *Epigraphia Carnatica* is the foundational source for Karnataka's pre-modern history; without it, the documentary record for over a millennium of Kannada civilization would be largely inaccessible to modern scholarship.
- **Epigraphy as historical method:** Rice's work demonstrates the importance of epigraphical evidence for periods before administrative records—inscriptions are often the only contemporary documentation of political events, land rights, and social organization.
- **The colonial archivist's paradox:** Rice's work is a colonial project—a British official documenting the history of a colonized people—that produced results essential for post-colonial historical recovery. The relationship between colonial documentation and indigenous cultural recovery is complex and important.
- **Influence on Kannada historiography:** The entire modern historiography of Karnataka—from the work of R. Narasimhacharya through S. Srikanta Sastri to modern scholars—is built on the foundation Rice laid. His work's influence on the Karnataka cultural revival is incalculable.
- **Scale and methodology:** The consistency of Rice's methodology across 12 volumes—the standards he applied to transcription, transliteration, and translation—established practices that subsequent epigraphers followed and that enabled the comparative work the corpus makes possible.

## My Takeaways

1. *Epigraphia Carnatica* demonstrated to me what primary source documentation actually looks like at scale: thousands of inscriptions, each requiring specific philological, paleographical, and historical expertise, compiled over decades.
2. Reading the inscriptions—even in translation—gave me direct contact with the voices of medieval Karnataka in a way that secondary histories cannot: the actual words of a Hoysala general's memorial, a merchant's temple donation, a ruler's copper plate grant.
3. The question of how much of Karnataka's history would be recoverable without Rice's work is sobering: enormous amounts of material culture, social history, and institutional history would simply be inaccessible. Documentation is not neutral—it is the precondition for historical understanding.
4. The project showed me how much of what we know about pre-modern Indian history depends on the very uneven accident of which materials survived and who chose to document them. History is the record of what happened to be recorded.
