# ॐλ

I have forayed in to FP multiple times [^19]. However λ calculus is something I keep coming back to in various levels of detail.

The first time I looked at in seriousness was [^1] which is the best introduction to λ calculus I have seen.

```
⍵ or loop = (λ.x x x) (λ.x x x)

If Y given f, x is is written as f( f (x)) and x is substituted by f(x), we have recursion.

Y f x = f(f(f(.... (f(x))))

//  Y combinator
Y = λ.f (λ.x f (x x)) (λ.x f (x x))

=> λ.f (λ.x f ((λ.x f (x x)) (λ.x f (x x)))) 

=>  λ.f (λ.x f (f (λ.x f (x x)) (λ.x f (x x))))

=> λ.f (λ.x f (f (λ.x f ((λ.x f (x x)) (λ.x f (x x))))))

...

Y f x = f (f x)

```

I had encountered fixed points in compiler backend code - primarily to eliminate cycles in graphs and my forays in to FP.
Also it is often mentioned that recursion can be converted to iteration for performance reasons - representing the FP and Imperative view of the same problem. It is interesting to know that a problem is considered computable if there's a recursive algorithm for it.

While the methods to convert from recursion to iteration or vice-versa are somewhat known to programmers, the formal methods are
often quite opaque. The most interesting part of the Y combinator in the context of λ calculus is that a simple language that does not
support recursion is used to implement recursion. Conversely the notion of identifying fixed points in code is used in code with recursive types
to extract a concrete type. More will be said in [^1]

While doing some research on lambda calculus (postfix) for a usecase I had, I chanced upon the De bruijn index: [^5]

From which I translated the pun:

```
ಏಕೆ = [ [೧ (೦ ೦)] [೧ (೦ ೦)] ]

Eke = [ [1 (0 0)] [1 (0 0)] ]
```

In the standard form,

```
Y = λf. (λx. f (x x)) λx. f (x x)
```

can be written as:

```
ಏಕೆ = ॐಅ . (ॐಉ . ಅ (ಉ ಉ)) ॐಉ . ಅ (ಉ ಉ)

Eke = Om a . (Om u . a (u u)) Om u . a (u u)
```

Without any semantic change.

Haskell uses \ for λ and -> for .

Pretty cool to use as a basis for any generative language.

If that’s too abstract, see this [^2]
To see how easily program structure is derived from lambda calculus.

I was trying to understand Tree Sitter [^8] a VS code plugin that lets you do AST searches and highlights in your editor based on the grammar of a language of your choice. I was experimenting with a grammar for λ calculus since its a good starting point.

It's very tempting to state that λ calculus is a great start for a small programming language.
However it's small but not easy to use as a direct programming language esp if you see how numbers are defined.
To understand levels of expressivity: [^3] was quite useful.


As we go up the expressive chain of λ calculus 
1. Untyped λ Calculus [^22]
1. Simply Typed λ calculus [^21]
1. System F [^20]
1. System F⍵ [^20]

Alternate systems that come up are:
1. SKI Calculus [^6]
2. Iota and Jot [^7]
3. Generalized Recursion [^8]

Full fledged fields of study:
1. Predicate Logic [^23]
2. Category Theory [^26]
3. λ calculus [^22]
4. Turing Machines [^27]

The equivalences between the above feilds of study have been known since [^28]

[^24] [^25] provides a rosetta stone between Logic, Computation, Category Thoery, Physics and Topology.

Benjamin Pierce's classic books provide the best introduction to Type theory. [^29] [^30] [^31] are great resources.

Category Theory can get pretty abstract for working programmers. I found Bartosz's videos, blogs and book a good way to understand
some basics [^32] [^33]
