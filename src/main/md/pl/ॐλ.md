# ॐλ

I have forayed in to FP multiple times [^19]. However λ calculus is something I keep coming back to in various levels of detail.

The first time I looked at in seriousness was [^1] which is the best introduction to λ calculus I have seen.

⍵ or loop = (λ.x x x) (λ.x x x)

If Y given f, x is is written as f( f (x)) and x is substituted by f(x), we have recursion.

Y f x = f(f(f(.... (f(x))))

//  Y combinator
Y = λ.f (λ.x f (x x)) (λ.x f (x x))
=> λ.f (λ.x f ((λ.x f (x x)) (λ.x f (x x)))) 
=>  λ.f (λ.x f (f (λ.x f (x x)) (λ.x f (x x))))
=> λ.f (λ.x f (f (λ.x f ((λ.x f (x x)) (λ.x f (x x))))))
...

Y f x = f (f x)

I had encountered fixed points in compiler backend code - primarily to eliminate cycles in graphs and my forays in to FP.

If you remember this there was a practical reason to do some research on lambda calculus (postfix)
for a usecase I had, I chanced upon the De bruijn index: [^5]

From which I translated the pun:
ಏಕೆ = [ [೧ (೦ ೦)] [೧ (೦ ೦)] ]
Eke = [ [1 (0 0)] [1 (0 0)] ]

In the standard form,
Y = λf. (λx. f (x x)) λx. f (x x)

can be written as:
ಏಕೆ = ॐಅ . (ॐಉ . ಅ (ಉ ಉ)) ॐಉ . ಅ (ಉ ಉ)
Eke = Om a . (Om u . a (u u)) Om u . a (u u)
Without any semantic change.

Haskell uses \ for λ and -> for .

Pretty cool to use as a basis for any generative language.

If that’s too abstract, see this [^2]
To see how easily program structure is derived from lambda calculus.

It's very tempting to state that λ calculus is a great start for a small programming language.
However it's small but not easy to use.
