brahmi contains nushell scripts to auto generate wiki tables for
  1. consonant and vowel combinations
  2. consonant and consonant combinations

for a variety of brahmic scripts like:
1. Asokan brahmi
2. kannaDa
3. devanAgari
4. grantha
5. tamiZ

It includes extensions to generate mappings for scripts used for standardization:
  1. ISO
  2. HK
  3. IPA (WIP)
  4. IAST (WIP)

Further it provides ability to provide suggested mappings for:
  1. ellara kannaDa
  2. Eke for ellara kannaDa.

It was primarily written to auto generate mappings for the Eke proposal to
transliterate Indic languages to English script.

Each script is tabularized in a nushell module with the intention of displaying
each scripts permutations in a table that resembles the brahmic ordering used
commonly in Indic scripts.

Install nushell as shown in : https://www.nushell.sh/

It can be run using:
nu brahmi.nu

WIP:
1. Refactor consonant and vowel mapping generation code into smaller functions
2. Remove hardcodings for wiki format and support wiki/git md format
3. Add more scripts as drop in - malayalam, telugu etc.
4. Fix bug in Ellara Kannada combination generator for nga/nya.
5. Make script callable with different options.
